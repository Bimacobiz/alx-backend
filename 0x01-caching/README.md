# Caching

## Introduction

This project implements a caching system in Python using a class-based approach. Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a faster-accessible storage location, such as memory or disk, to reduce the time needed to fetch the data from its original source.

## Description

The caching system consists of a `Cache` class that provides methods to store and retrieve data. It uses a dictionary to store key-value pairs, where the keys represent the data to be cached, and the values represent the cached data itself.

## Prototype

The `Cache` class has the following prototype:

```python
class Cache:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize an empty cache dictionary
        pass

    def store(self, key, value):
        # Store the key-value pair in the cache
        pass

    def retrieve(self, key):
        # Retrieve the value associated with the given key from the cache
        pass
